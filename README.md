# tipsy_react

This is the second version of a langauge learning matching app that I rebuilt from here (https://github.com/maddyking44/tipsy) in React. 

The user can build a profile, select the languages they speak, view the profiles of people who also speak those languages, match with them, and if that person matches back they can chat. 

I built the chatroom in React using databases. A challenge was getting the chat room window to automatically scroll to the bottom of the chats when the page loaded (without scrolling to the bottom of the whole page). 

The product's name changed to Lingua Libre.
